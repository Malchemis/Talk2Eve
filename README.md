# Talk2Eve - Main Project
Talk2Eve is a Mult-Framework based chatbot that revolves around using the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base. 

Below, the 5 parts the project needs to function :
- Flutter App : https://github.com/B3LIOTT/chatbot_insa
- MiddleWare (Flask) : https://github.com/aymane59/ChatBot_echanges
- RabbiMQ (we used a docker)
- Ai (Transformers and MITRE) : https://github.com/Malchemis/Talk2Eve-AI
- MongoDB database (also a docker)
